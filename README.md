ETD is an application that will allow you to request parcel transfer services and carry out formalities or face-to-face procedures.
Register and select the service that best suits your needs. We can coordinate to provide you with a personalized service thanks to the fact that we have vehicles of different sizes: bicycle, motorcycle, car and van. The best of this? You will pay the right price per kilometer of distance.
Developed in java DB Firebase

# DidoxDelivery:
Application that I have developed for the FIX SERVICES company, the objective of the application is to deliver documents for internal clients such as (BCI / delivery of documents, Cuponatic delivery of products, etc.)
the app was developed completely from scratch with api 21 as the minimum sdk in android that is equivalent to android 5.0 lollipop
Requirements: Create an app that allows users to register and log in.
At the moment of connecting in the app there is a socket listener that is looking for new requests generated by clients on the web platform, in case there is a pending request it will automatically show a notification where the driver can accept or reject said request
When accepting the request, it will show the path to the sender to remove the product. Here we are handling error states in case there is a problem.
When the delivery arrives, you must request a confirmation code from the sender before removing the product.
if everyone is ok we will show another route to the bone recipient where the delivery has to deliver the product
we are also handling error states in case there is a problem with the delivery
Arriving at the recipient, the driver has to ask the customer for a verification code before delivering the product.
at the end of the process we send the driver in the available list to receive another request
I should mention when the driver is making a delivery he cannot receive more requests until the product delivery process is finished
